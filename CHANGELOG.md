# 1.2.1

- ChoiceType: make sure that `getData` reflects the default selected <option>

# 1.2.0

- Refactor child-closing behavior.
  Fixes issues with attempting to close
  not-rendered children, and separates concerns, some.
  
  Note that closing a view no longer removes it's from
  the parent view -- meaning that it will still provide
  data to parent GroupTypes.
  If you want to fully remove a child, you'll need to
  call `parentForm.removeChild()`, instead of just `child.close()`.
